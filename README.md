# Cloud_based_antivirus
In this project, we create a cloud-based antivirus, Bug Defender, which scans files for malware. This AV software uses 3 antivirus engines in parallel to detect the viruses. As this is based on N-Version programming technique, the chances of detecting a virus is a lot higher than that of a single AV software.
